# PURPOSE

In this course, I will explore how code can be used as a creative medium to build
immersive, interactive experiences for the web. I will experiment with visual and
spatial elements, user input, and real-world data to create engaging, responsive
projects.

Through hands-on exploration of industry-relevant tools and techniques, I will learn
how to craft web-based experiences that are both technically dynamic and creatively
expressive.

By the end of the course, I will have developed an interactive piece that demonstrates
your ability to combine design, code, and interaction in imaginative ways.
